    "In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",

If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!"

    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",

    "I think the key to finding optimal features was through a focus on word selection. I tried adding different combinations of words, and looked for their frequency. I think more frequent words help with accuracy. I was having an issue with both over fitting, and under fitting. I thought adding more words would of course increase accuracy. but, this didn't work. I also tried just using a few very frequent words but this didn't work too well either. I found it interesting that punctuations could be important features to include."

    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
